Today i will start my project to recreate the google homepage, i will update the git repository so i can get used to using it.

I added hovering outlines my lack of skill made me do this very slowly, perhaps i should prioritize other things before. however i'm quite proud about how they look.

Today i moved and centered everything, added the navbars and did a lot of experimentation, A LOT, MY HEAD HURTS, it was very fun though, or so it seems now that i managed to do so, the navbars are kinda ugly, but i'm still proud with the buttons, i also added the "i'm feeling lucky", however the search form is still there somehow, but i'll fix it tomorrow.
After that i'll try to fix a bit of the details with the font and the navbar and such.
